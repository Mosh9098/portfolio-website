    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>
      A highly motivated and adaptable software engineer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development. Proficient in a wide range of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and modern frameworks like React, Flask, and Node.js. Experienced in designing and building responsive, user-friendly applications with a focus on scalability and performance.

    <p>
      Passionate about solving complex problems through code, I have a demonstrated ability to work across the full development lifecycle â€” from conceptualizing project requirements to deploying robust applications. My ability to quickly learn new technologies and my eagerness to tackle challenging problems has enabled me to continuously grow as a developer. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to building innovative solutions, but I am equally comfortable working independently to achieve project goals.

    <p>
      Having worked on a variety of projects ranging from a school management system to a real estate website, I have honed my skills in database management, API integration, and user interface design. I am dedicated to developing efficient and clean code that not only meets user requirements but also enhances the overall user experience.

      I am also an excellent communicator with a proven ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, making me an asset in cross-functional teams. Always seeking new learning opportunities, I am committed to staying updated with the latest industry trends and best practices to ensure the continuous improvement of my skills and the quality of the software I deliver.
